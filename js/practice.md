# practicing core fundamentals

- conditional statements
- looping
- property access
- etc

# practicing all these principles with primitive and non-primitive values

    - each of these concepts should (if applicable)
    - include primitive examples like (string, boolean, null, undefined)
    - include non-primitive examples like (objects, arrays)

### an example of this (principle being conditionals statements)

```
// primitive example
const str = ''
if (str.length) {
 // set a variable to test or something...
}

// non-primitive example
const obj = {name: 'Jane'}
if (obj.name == 'Jane') {
    // set a variable to test or something...
}
```
